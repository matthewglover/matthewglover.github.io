### [React, Redux, Material UI Boilerplate](https://github.com/matthewglover/react-redux-material-ui)
React is great but there are so many other pieces of the puzzle: how to compile it, how to write tests, how to manage state. So I've built a [boilerplate todo application](https://github.com/matthewglover/react-redux-material-ui), using React, Redux and Material-UI which leans heavily on the Redux todo application.

### [Hapi wrapper](https://github.com/matthewglover/hapi-wrapper)
Simple promise-based wrapper around Hapi.js.

### [React, Hapi.js, Facebook Oauth](https://github.com/matthewglover/hapi-react-base)
App designed to run both a Hapi api and a React front-end. Largely superseded by [React, Redux, Material UI Boilerplate](https://github.com/matthewglover/react-redux-material-ui) application, but good working example of Oauth login using Hapi plugins and auth schemes with tests.
