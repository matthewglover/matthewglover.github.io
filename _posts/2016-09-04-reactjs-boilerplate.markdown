React is great but there are so many other pieces of the puzzle: how to compile it, how to write tests, how to manage state. So I've built a [boilerplate todo application](https://github.com/matthewglover/react-redux-material-ui), using React, Redux and Material-UI which leans heavily on the Redux todo application.

To run, clone the repo and run:

{% highlight javascript %}
npm install
npm run dev
{% endhighlight %}
