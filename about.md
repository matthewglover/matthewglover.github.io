Matt is a full-stack JavaScript Developer at Founders and Coders CIC, currently building web applications with Node.js and React. He enjoys helping people discover the power and fun of programming and volunteers at Coding for Everyone and Codebar.io.

Matt is interested in functional and reactive programming, and hopes one day to be able to fully understand Monads. For fun, he has recently been dabbling with Haskell and Elixir.

Matt has returned to web development following an extended sabbatical, in which he retrained as a commercial contracts lawyer, worked in the City of London for leading international law firms, and obtained an MBA. He is pragmatic, solutions-oriented and a good communicator, with extensive experience working in multi-disciplinary teams.

Matt has worked with many languages and frameworks over the years: from CGI to PHP and Rails, on the backend, and from plain old HTML to Flash and ActionScript on the client. He remembers the days of Netscape 4 and IE Mac, and spent many years building pixel-perfect cross-browser code using nested tables and spacer gifs. He therefore really appreciates the power and elegance of modern CSS.
